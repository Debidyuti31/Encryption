# Encryption

## What is Encryption?
Encryption is the ability of transforming data or information to the form that cannot be understood by those who are not authorized access to it. This changes the original plain readable information (plaintext) to the form that cannot be understood (cryptography or ciphertext) through use of a definite technique and a key.Cipher: Only the recipient can decode the message whether he/she uses a computer or any other computing device since only he/she has the right decryption key.

## Why encryption is important?

Encryption is important because it provides several critical functions for maintaining the security and privacy of data, especially in the digital age. Here are the main reasons:

1. Data Confidentiality
2. Data Integrity
3. Authentication
4. Privacy
5. Secure Communication & Protection against Cyber Threats

## Key components of Encryption:
1. Algorithm
2. Plaintext
3. Ciphertext
4. Secret Key

## About Code
Libraries required for the program :
1. Random module
2. String module
